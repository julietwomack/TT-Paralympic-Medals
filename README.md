# Tidy Tuesday Week 32: Paralympic-Medals

Used the TidyVerse package in R to perform data wrangling and EDA on a dataset with 19,000+ rows about Paralympic medals won between 1980 and 2016. After cleaning the data, Tableau was used to create a dynamic dashboard to display Paralympic medals won by Gender and Event type depending on the Country and Year.
